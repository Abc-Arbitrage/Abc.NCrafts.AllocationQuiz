# ABC Arbitrage quiz for NCrafts 2015-2018

## Three different quizzes in one app

This project is a small quiz application we let people play with on our ABC Arbitrage booth at the last four [NewCrafts conference editions](http://ncrafts.io/) in Paris.

You can choose from three different C# quizzes:

* A general performance quiz: _Which code is more likely to run faster?_ (2016 edition)
* A more specific one: _Which code doesn't allocate on the heap?_ (2015 edition)
* A performance quiz centered on new features in C# 7.2 and .Net Core 2.1 (2018 edition)
